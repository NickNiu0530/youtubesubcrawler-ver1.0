# youtubesubcrawler-ver1.0
Hello, this is Nick.
I’m an English interpreting student at Renmin University of China.
In this era of artificial intelligence,
medical English and terminology are among my key research interests.
So I built this tool myself to efficiently crawl and organize YouTube subtitles.
I hope you find it useful, interesting, and efficient!
